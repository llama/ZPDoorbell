ZPDoorbell
==========

Zeta Psi doorbell (iOS), which is running on an iPod touch.

The following would need to be done to actually duplicate our setup:

-Get a copy of the doorbell server running (wex has it)
-Copy "credentials-example.m" to "credentials.m", and insert creds, IP, and port corresponding to the server
-Run this app on an iOS device!
